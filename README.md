Code for Google Foo Bar Challenge


The Google Foo Bar is an invitation-only coding challenge that is used as part of their recruiting process. There are several levels (usually 4 or 5), each with single to multi-part challenges.

This repo contains solutions to the problems that I completed, but does not contain datasets or full problem descriptions.
